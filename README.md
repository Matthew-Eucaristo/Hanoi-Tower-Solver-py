# Hanoi-Tower-Solver-py
This solves normal Hanoi Tower Problem that asked frequently on classes. <br>
This simple solver uses a very simple algorithm (wihtout recursion) to give a proper solution on solving n poles. <br>
Notice that this only moves all leftmost disks to the rightmost pole. <br>
Also the pole count depend on how many disks the pole have. ex. 3 disks = 3 poles
